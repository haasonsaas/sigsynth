# SigSynth Configuration Example
# Copy this file to 'sigsynth.yaml' and customize for your needs

# Core test generation settings
seed_samples: 5              # Number of AI-generated seed samples per rule (1-50)
samples: 200                 # Total test cases to generate per rule (10-5000)
random_seed: 42              # Set for reproducible results (optional)

# Platform configurations
platforms:
  panther:
    name: panther
    output_format: json
    custom_options:
      test_prefix: "test_"     # Prefix for test file names
      include_metadata: true   # Include generation metadata

# Batch processing settings
batch:
  input_patterns:            # File patterns to include
    - "**/*.yml"
    - "**/*.yaml"
  exclude_patterns:          # Patterns to exclude
    - "**/draft/**"          # Draft rules
    - "**/experimental/**"   # Experimental rules
    - "**/*.disabled.yml"    # Disabled rules
    - "**/test/**"           # Test files
  parallel_workers: 4        # Number of parallel workers (adjust for your CPU)
  fail_fast: false          # Stop on first error (set true for CI/CD)

# Debug settings (for development)
debug:
  enabled: false            # Enable debug output
  verbose: false            # Verbose debug information
  trace_validation: false   # Trace rule validation steps

# Example configurations for different environments:

# Development (fast iteration):
# seed_samples: 3
# samples: 100
# batch:
#   parallel_workers: 2
#   fail_fast: false
# debug:
#   enabled: true

# Production (comprehensive testing):
# seed_samples: 15
# samples: 1000
# batch:
#   parallel_workers: 16
#   fail_fast: true

# CI/CD (balanced speed and coverage):
# seed_samples: 5
# samples: 200
# batch:
#   parallel_workers: 8
#   fail_fast: true
